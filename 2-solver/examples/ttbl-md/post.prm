1    # post_mean          ! Compute mean statistics
0    # post_vort          ! Compute mean vorticity and mean gradient
0    # post_diss          ! Compute mean total dissipation rate
0    # post_corz          ! Compute correlation functions along z (a previous run with post_mean = 1 must be performed)
0    # post_tke_eq        ! Compute fluctuating terms of TKE equations (a previous run with post_mean = 1 must be performed)
